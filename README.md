## Redis usage
- Save/load main courses of the menu

## Work flow
1. Start Discovery service first.
2. Run Table and Reservation services before User service.
3. Run Redis server before Menu service: Redis -> 64 BIT -> redis-server

## Constraints
### Account

- User, password and email are required for creating new account

### Reservation
